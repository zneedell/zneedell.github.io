We present a hydrodynamic lattice gas model for two-dimensional flows on curved surfaces with dynamical geometry. This model is an extension to two dimensions of the dynamical geometry lattice gas model previously studied in one-dimension. We expand upon a variation of the two- dimensional flat space FHP model created by Frisch, Hasslacher and Pomeau, and independently by Wolfram, and modified by Boghosian, Love, and Meyer. We define a hydrodynamic lattice gas model on an arbitrary triangulation, whose flat space limit is the FHP model. Rules that change the geometry are constructed using the Pachner moves, which alter the triangulation but
not the topology. We present results on the growth of the number of triangles as a function of time. Simulations show that the number of triangles lattice grows with time as t^3, in agreement a mean field prediction. We also present preliminary results on the distribution of curvature over a typical triangulation for these simulations.

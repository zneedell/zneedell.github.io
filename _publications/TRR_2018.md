Abstract
------

Mesoscopic transport models can efficiently simulate complex travel behavior and traffic patterns over large networks, but simulating energy consumption in these models is difficult with traditional methods. Since mesoscopic transport models rely on a simplified handling of traffic flow, they cannot provide the second-by-second measurement of vehicle speeds and accelerations that are required for accurately estimating energy consumption. Here we present extensions to the TripEnergy model that fill in the gaps of low-resolution trajectories with realistic, contextual driving behavior. TripEnergy also includes a vehicle energy model capable of simulating the impact of traffic conditions on energy consumption and CO2 emissions, with inputs in the form of widely-available calibration data, allowing it to simulate thousands of different real-world vehicle makes and models. This design allows TripEnergy to integrate with mesoscopic transport models and to be fast enough to run on a large network with minimal additional computation time. We expect it to benefit from and enable advances in transport simulation, including optimizing traffic network controls to minimize energy, evaluating the performance of different vehicle technologies under wide-scale adoption, and better understanding the energy and climate impacts of new infrastructure and policies.

This is my personal website. It has some projects that I've worked on and information about me. It is also still under construction, so please forgive the incompleteness. I am currently on the job market--please feel free to get in touch!

Academic and Professional Interests
------

I recently finished my PhD in Transportation at MIT. My research there focused on modeling energy consumption in personal vehicles, with the goal of informing climate and energy policy. In particular, I have focused on quantifying range limitations in electric vehicles, understanding the interactions between electric vehicle charging and a cleaner electrical grid, and understanding the relationship between individual travel choices and systemwide transport network energy efficiency.

More generally, my goal is to use data, simulation, and mathematical modeling to make our transportation systems more efficient, sustainable, and just. I am most interested in big picture questions about modeling--how the thoughtful construction and use of well-designed models of the transportation sector can inform policymaking, technology development, and urban planning.

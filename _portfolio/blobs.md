This was a class project based on some [papers](http://www.uvm.edu/pdodds/files/papers/others/everything/makse1999a.pdf) that have looked at correlated [percolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation_theory) as a mechanism for reproducing patterns observed in city structure. This demo is written in matlab and allows you to set different density levels and correlation distances while observing how they change the critical percolation density and the size distribution of connected areas.
